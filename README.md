# Portfolio-Site
NotSelwyn's portfolio website. Made by a back-end developer. This is the source code for [shitdev.nl](https://shitdev.nl). I made this website to practice basic web development and make APIs for my code. An example of a project that uses my API is my [Github profile README](https://shitdev.nl/Notselwyn/Notselwyn).
